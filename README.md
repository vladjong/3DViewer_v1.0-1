# **DOCUMENTATION 3D\_VIEWER\_V1.0**
## **LET'S GO!**
**3D\_VIEWER\_V1.0** - is an application that allows you to view 3D models in parallel and central projection. 

#### **BASIC APP FUNCTIONS:**
1. Window for **selecting** and **entering** the name of the .obj file.
1. Object **moving** by oX, oY, oZ.
1. Object **rotation** by oX, oY, oZ.
1. Object **approximation** by oX, oY, oZ.
1. Model information: number of **points** and **edges**.
1. Editor settings
#### **FINISHED MODELS:**
- BIBICA.obj
- BUNNY.obj
- CUB.obj
- DOMIC.obj
- GNOME.obj
- GOURD.obj
- KETTLE.obj
- LAMP.obj
- OCTAIDER.obj
- TETRAIDER.obj
#### **HOW TO USE:**
1. To choose a model, you need to **add** or **select** its name.
1. For the model to appear on the screen, press the **"START"** button.
1. To move, rotation the model, you need to enter a value in the box and click on the axis button **"oX", "oY", "oZ"**.
1. To scale the model, you need to enter a value in the box and click on the axis button **"-", "+"**.
1. To change the settings, you need to click on the button **"SETTING"**.
#### **RECOMENDATION:**
1. Don't enter invalid/empty files. Example: **".obj"**.
1. Don't use large files. Up to **3 Mb**.
1. Set correct moving, rotate, and scale values. Example: **"10 - oX"**.
### **LET'S TALK ABOUT SETTING**
**Setting** - This is a feature of the editor that allows you to customize it.

#### **HOW TO USE:**
1. Window for **selecting** and **entering** the name of the .obj file.
1. Object **moving** by oX, oY, oZ.
1. Object **rotation** by oX, oY, oZ.
1. Object **approximation** by oX, oY, oZ.
1. Model information: number of **points** and **edges**.
1. Editor settings
#### **TYPES OF PROJECTION:**
1. **"The Parallel projection"** - wis a type of projection that uses parallel projecting rays.
1. **"The Central projection"** - of a point is the point of intersection of the projecting line passing through the projection center and the projection object (point) with the projection plane.

You can choose the **SOLID** or **DOTTED** line. 
#### **TYPES OF COLORS:**
1. **GOLD** - it is this is the main color for line.
1. **WHITE**.
1. **VIOLET**.
1. **CARBONIC** - it is this is the main color for background.
1. **WAVE** - color reminiscent of the bottomless ocean.
1. **DRACULA** - color taken from the most popular theme for VSCode "Dracula".

You can set the line and point **thickness**. 
#### **RECOMENDATION:**
- don't enter thickness values. Example: term: -1221312 or 100
- maximum thickness values = 50
